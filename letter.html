          <p>My love,</p>

          <p>
            Happy Valentine's Day — our first one together, in the same home, in
            this little everyday life. If you told me a year ago that I'd be
            here writing this next to you, I would've cried on the spot. Because
            last year we were doing love the hard way: long-distance, time
            zones, missing each other in the small moments, counting down days
            like it was a sport. And now… I get to live in the “after.” I get to
            live in the part we used to dream about.
          </p>

          <p>
            I keep thinking about how love looks different when it's no longer
            just longing, but presence. It's not only the big declarations —
            it's the quiet routines. It's our evenings that somehow feel like
            the safest place in the world. It's sitting together with a series
            playing, cooking like we're trying to impress a Michelin judge, then
            laughing because we absolutely know we'd eat our own food in a
            restaurant and be proud.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's our little rituals: Yathzee and Uno — where I always start
            winning… and somehow still end up losing. But even then, I still
            feel like I'm the one who wins, because I get to do life with you.
            And then there's Mia, our tiny, hungry shadow. Even if,
            realistically, I'm just a background character in her life, I love
            her to death too. And honestly, it's incredible — that quiet kind of
            love that exists on the couch late in the evening, when you're deep
            asleep, and everything feels soft and calm and safe. Moments like
            that make me think,
            <em>this is it… this is home.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I know we're going through a lot right now. Life hasn't exactly been
            gentle. But I want you to know this: I'm not here only for the easy
            chapters. I'm here for the real ones. I'm here when things are
            uncertain, when we're tired, when the world feels heavy, when we
            have to be brave in ways we didn't plan. I believe in you — not in a
            “you'll be fine” way, but in a “I see your heart, your strength,
            your effort, your loyalty, your patience” way. I believe in us. I
            believe we can build something steady even when everything around us
            is loud.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for loving me with consistency. For motivating me. For
            letting me be soft when I need to be, and strong when I have to be.
            For making me feel like I'm not alone — like we're a team, always.
          </p>

          <p>
            And I can't end this without saying it: last year, I made you a
            video where I said, “Next year we'll spend it together.” And today
            I'm here. We did it. We made it to the promise. And this is only the
            beginning.
          </p>

          <p>Happy first Valentine's Day together, my love.</p>

          <p>
            Forever yours,<br />
            Tu dulcesita
