            <p>
              Happy Valentine's Day, our first one together, in the same home,
              in this little everyday life. If you told me a year ago that I'd
              be here writing this next to you, I would've cried on the spot.
              Because last year we were doing love the hard way: long-distance,
              time zones, missing each other in the small moments, counting down
              days like it was a sport. And now… I get to live in the “after.” I
              get to live in the part we used to dream about.
            </p>

            <p>
              I keep thinking about how love looks different when it's no longer
              just longing, but presence. It's not only the big declarations,
              it's the quiet routines. It's our evenings that somehow feel like
              the safest place in the world. It's sitting together with a series
              playing, cooking like we're trying to impress a Michelin judge,
              then laughing because we absolutely know we'd eat our own food in
              a restaurant and be proud.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's our little rituals: Yathzee and Cards, where I always start
              winning… and somehow still end up losing. But even then, I still
              feel like I'm the one who wins, because I get to do life with you.
              And then there's Mia, our tiny, hungry shadow. Even if,
              realistically, I'm just a background character in her life, I love
              her to death too. And honestly, it's incredible, that quiet kind
              of love that exists on the couch late in the evening, when you're
              deep asleep, and everything feels soft and calm and safe. Moments
              like that make me think,
              <em>this is it… this is home.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I know we're going through a lot right now. Life hasn't exactly
              been gentle. But I want you to know this: I'm not here only for
              the easy chapters. I'm here for the real ones. I'm here when
              things are uncertain, when we're tired, when the world feels
              heavy, when we have to be brave in ways we didn't plan. I believe
              in you, not in a <em>“you'll be fine” </em>way, but in a “I see
              your heart, your strength, your effort, your loyalty, your
              patience” way. I believe in us. I believe we can build something
              steady even when everything around us is loud.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank you for loving me with consistency. For motivating me. For
              letting me be soft when I need to be, and strong when I have to
              be. For making me feel like I'm not alone, we're a team, always.
            </p>

            <p>
              And I can't end this without saying it: last year, I made you a
              <a
                href="assets/videos/Valentine-video.mp4"
                class="open-video"
                data-video="assets/videos/valentine-video.mp4"
                >video</a
              >
              where I said, “Last Valentine's Day Apart.” And today I'm here. We
              did it. We made it to the promise. And this is only the beginning.
            </p>

            <p>Happy first Valentine's Day together, my love.</p>
